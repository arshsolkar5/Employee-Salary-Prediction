## 💼 Employee Salary Prediction using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates the practical use of supervised machine learning models to **predict employee salaries** based on features such as experience, education, job role, department, and performance.

### 🚀 Key Features

* Supports **real-time CSV uploads** for salary predictions.
* Models used: **Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**.
* Includes **SHAP-based visual explanations** for transparency.
* Generates a **downloadable PDF report** with prediction results.
* Deployed via **Ngrok** for live access.
* Built using **Streamlit**, **scikit-learn**, **SHAP**, **matplotlib**, and **Plotly**.

### 📂 Files in This Repo

* `Employee Salary Prediction Project.ipynb` – Main Jupyter notebook for model building and evaluation.
* `complex_employee_data.csv` – Dataset used for training.
